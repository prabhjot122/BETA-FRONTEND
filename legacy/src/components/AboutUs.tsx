            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              The word <strong>‚ÄúVriksh‚Äù</strong> means <em>tree</em> in Sanskrit. Just like a tree provides shade, fruits, and oxygen, <strong>LawVriksh was created to nurture and spread the wisdom of law.</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lawyers gain visibility by sharing their experience.</li>
              <li>Law students and academics build credibility by publishing insights.</li>
              <li>The larger community benefits from accessible, high-quality legal knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              LawVriksh was born out of a simple observation: <strong>India lacks a central space where legal voices can express themselves freely and be discovered.</strong> Our mission is to fill that gap.
